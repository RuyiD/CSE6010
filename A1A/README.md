Description
-------------

This program is used to generator a random 0-1 matrix, the probability of '1' is globally defined as p. The size of the matrix is defined as (m,n). After generating the matrix, we modify the matrix that every row and line which has an '1', should be modified to '1'.


Installation
------------

To install, simply run

    gcc matrixGenerator.c -o matrixGenerator.out

Execution
-----------

Assuming your executable is called "matrixGenerator.out", run it using

    ./matrixGenerator.out
